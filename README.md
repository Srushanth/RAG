# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Demo

This project demonstrates a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using a domain-specific PDF document as a knowledge source. It showcases how to combine information retrieval and generative AI to answer questions based on external documents.

## ðŸ“„ Data Source

The RAG system references the following industry report:

**EY India Energy Sector at Cross Roads**  
[Download PDF](https://www.ey.com/content/dam/ey-unified-site/ey-com/en-in/insights/energy-resources/documents/2024/ey-india-energy-sector-at-cross-roads.pdf)

This report provides critical insights into trends, challenges, and opportunities within Indiaâ€™s energy landscape.

## ðŸš€ Features

- PDF ingestion and chunking for semantic search
- Embedding generation for document chunks
- Retrieval of contextually relevant sections using vector search
- Question-answer generation using a large language model

## ðŸ§° Tech Stack

- Python  
- LlamaIndex  
- Vector DB: TODO  
- OpenAI / Hugging Face models  
- Streamlit / Gradio (optional for UI)

## ðŸ“¦ Getting Started

Instructions coming soon.
